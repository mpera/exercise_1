Investigating whether patient survey scores are correlated with hospital quality scores

For patient survey responses, there were actually many hospitals tied at 80 for the highest score and 0 for the lowest score (see query results below).

To evaluate if patient scores are correlated with hospital quality scores, I created a table with the average quality score for each hospital. I then performed a corr() function on the average quality score and the patient survey response score. The correlation was weakly negative (-0.218), indicating that patient survey scores and quality scores for each hospital were actually inversely related; that is, as patient survey scores increase, hospital quality scores decrease. However, it is unclear what value this correlation coefficient actually gives. The coefficient did not come with a p-value, so it is hard to say whether it is statistically significant. Additionally, a weak correlation like -0.218 is not very practically significant. 

What this finding suggests is that patient perceptions of hospitals capture different information than quality scores from more “official” measures. For example, Falls Community Hospital had an average quality score that was far and above the best quality score for all the hospitals, but their patient rating was only 62. Perhaps the staff at a certain hospital is very effective in terms of providing consistent and quality care, but they are non-communicative with patients; or, hospital procedures are inefficient and make patients wait a long time for quality care. This indicates that hospitals should take into account both their quality scores and patient survey scores in order to provide care that is both effective and valuable for patients.
