Investigating the best hospitals

To evaluate the best hospitals, I used a joint approach of looking at quality scores from the effective care table and quality scores from the readmissions table. The top scoring hospital based on average overall effective care quality score was Falls Community Hospital and Clinic, and the top scoring hospital based on average readmission score was Maricopa Medical center. 

I dug a little deeper into these quality scores and evaluated hospitals on their average score for each medical procedure. The top scoring procedure across all hospitals was the median time from emergency room arrival to emergency room departure for admitted emergency room patients. The top scoring hospital overall for this procedure was again Falls Community hospital and clinic. The lowest scoring measure across all hospitals was patients leaving without being seen. The hospital that had the highest score for this procedure was Memorial Herman Baptist Orange hospital. 

Based on these results, it appears that Falls Community Hospital and Clinic is the best hospital when it comes to quality scores. It was the top scoring hospital overall, and it was also top scoring for a procedure in which all of the other hospitals also score highly. It was not in the top 10 for readmissions scores, however, so that may be an area of improvement for this hospital to explore. 

My approach is robust, as it investigates hospitals based on overall quality and readmission quality. I also investigated quality scores for specific procedures and evaluated how hospitals stack up against each other on the highest scoring and lowest scoring overall procedures.
