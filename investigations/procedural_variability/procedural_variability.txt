Investigating procedures with the greatest variability between hospitals

The procedure with the greatest variance in average quality score between hospitals was the median time from ED arrival to ED departure for patients admitted to ED. The second and third procedures with the greatest variance also had to do with times in the ED for patients (decision time to departure time, and time from arrival to departure). This indicates that ED procedures need to be assessed at the hospitals with the lowest average scores; they can perhaps learn from the hospitals with the highest average scores and change their procedures accordingly. 

The two procedures with the least variance in average quality score had to do with asthma care. This indicates that all hospitals either do really well, really poorly, or somewhere in the middle for asthma care. To investigate further, I performed a query to determine the highest average performing procedures overall. Systemic corticosteroids for inpatient asthma and relievers for inpatient asthma where the 3rd and 4th highest procedures. This indicates that all hospitals overall perform highly on these metrics.

These analyses show variance in hospitals when it comes to average scores for each procedure, so I feel confident in my analysis of the procedures with the greatest (and least) variability between hospitals. It would also be interesting to perform some ANOVA statistical tests on these to determine if the differences between hospitals were statistically significant.
